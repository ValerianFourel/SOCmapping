    A 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) prediction.

    This model is designed to process spatiotemporal data for SOC estimation, where:
    - Spatial dimensions (height, width) represent geographic coordinates or grid cells
    - Temporal dimension represents time series data (e.g., seasonal measurements)
    - Multiple input channels represent different environmental variables affecting SOC

    SOC Relevance:
    - SOC varies spatially across landscapes due to topography, land use, and soil properties
    - SOC changes temporally due to seasonal cycles, management practices, and climate
    - Multiple environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, vegetation indices, etc.) 
      influence SOC dynamics and need to be processed simultaneously
