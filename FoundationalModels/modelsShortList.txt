The idea of using Foundations models is to finetune the foundation models in the following way:

We input the tensors that we have collected on Google Earth Engine, and for a certain Foundations models we get a tensor of a certain size as output.
This output tensor is then passed though a simple MLP to regress the SOC amount.
From this computed SOC, we then compute a Loss (using L1 and/or L2 with regularisation) to backpropagate the gradients through the simple MLP and the foundation model.
After searching for the best parameters (we can try AutoML), we create a mapping.
